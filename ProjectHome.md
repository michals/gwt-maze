This is just for fun.

When I was a child, I loved to solve mazes. Unfortunately, nobody was patient enough to draw them form me over and over. Later on, my dad wrote a program in pascal to do it. Since then I dreamed to write such program as well. Finally, I have a bit of spare time to fulfill this dream, and since I love GWT, here is the gwt-maze project.

Have fun.
